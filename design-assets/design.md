# Databag UI Redesign

  
Here is the complete redesign of the UI for Databag. 
I have worked closely with @balzack and we feel it's in a pretty good state with lots of work ahead. 

I kept the illustrations already suggested by the community and also  kept the green hues of the current design.  

I applied standard design practices in font sizes, spacing  and icons. 
The font selected is [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter)  and for icons I used  [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com).

**Still missing:** 
- Dark Mode
- Animations
- Overall Branding (if seen necessary)
