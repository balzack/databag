# Databag Design Guidelines & Resources

A collection of design contribution guidelines and resources for our Databag product.

> **All participating designers are highly encouraged to shape and evolve these guidelines!**

## Welcome

Databag is a product targeted for the decentralized web community. It is a federeated messenger that gives people back their privacy and control of their data.

## How to contribute design

Here is the Link to the [Figma File](https://www.figma.com/design/eVFi8bYlybn5KeyEePEaey/Databag---Github?node-id=1-6&t=Is2AiTfwktFO5aY0-1).
Duplicate the Figma file to edit. Feedback on the UI/UX, bugs or features is greatly appreciated.
1. Check out open [issues](https://github.com/balzack/databag/issues) here on GitHub (we label them with `design: required`)
2. Feel free to open an issue on your own if you find something you would like to contribute to the project and use the `design: idea` label for it.
3. Add your contributions to an issue and we promise we will review your contribution carefully and foster discussions

**We encourage you to:**

- Get in touch with the team by starting a discussion on [GitHub](https://github.com/balzack/databag/discussions).

## Target audience

The initial users are typically very technical, but hopefully this product will be embedded into consumer electronics and reach a much less technical audience. The design may benefit by exposing some technical attributes. For example, with a self-hosted product the users my be interested in knowing where their data actually lives.

## Design relevant materials

Here is a list of design relevant information and materials:

### Fonts

Currently we're using Roboto everywhere.

### Colors

We're using shades of green deliberately staying away from the corporate blue. The current background color is (#8fbea7) with the primary button color (#448866).

### Logos

We don't really have a logo yet, and are currently just using a scaled image from the app as the [icon](https://github.com/balzack/databag/blob/main/doc/icon.png)

### Design Files, Screenshots, etc

We don't have any design files yet. Initially you can reference screenshots for the [browser app](https://github.com/balzack/databag/blob/main/doc/browser.png) and [mobile app](https://github.com/balzack/databag/blob/main/doc/mobile.png)
