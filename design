# Databag UI Redesign

  
After talking with @balzack I redesigned the app. 
I kept the illustrations already suggested by the community and also  kept the green hues of the current design.  

I applied standard design practices in font sizes, spacing  and icons. 

The font selected is [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter)  and for icons I used  [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com).

**Desktop Proposed Design**
